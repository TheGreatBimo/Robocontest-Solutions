#### Problem statement in short
You need to calculate the minimum number of days for Joseph Cooper to meet Murph. He is on day N of the week, and Murph is on day M. He can either wait for Murph’s day to come or use a time machine to go back one day at a time (each backward day takes one day).

Weekdays are numbered Monday = 1, …, Sunday = 7.

#### Solution
Easy-peasy lemon squeezy.
We are being asked: How can we go faster to that day: by going forward or backward in time?
Just calculate absolute distance between days if traveled back or forward.
