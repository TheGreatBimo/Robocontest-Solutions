#### Translation
In the country Bitlandia, there are n stations located on a coordinate grid. You can travel directly between two stations only if they lie on the same horizontal or vertical line.

BitVoy noticed that some stations are disconnected, meaning you can’t reach certain stations from others.

The governor orders him to build the minimum number of new stations to connect all stations. Your task is to help with this.

#### Solution
We will divide the stations into connected components (using DSU).
It can be proven that one new station can only connect TWO connected components.

Therefore, we find the number of connected components, and the result will be that number - 1;
As the number of stations is low (n <= 100), we can iterate over them in O(N^2) to find the number of components
total time complexity O(N^2*ack(N^2))
