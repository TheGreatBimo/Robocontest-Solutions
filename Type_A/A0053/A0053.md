#### Translation:
Happy Array

An array is called happy if it contains an equal number of even and odd numbers.

Given an array A of N elements, determine how many subarrays of A are happy arrays.

#### Solution:
There is a horribly inefficient solution with range dp which my stupid ass somehow tried.
However we will use an efficient O(N) solution.

Let's transform the array to 1 and -1:
an element is 1 if even, -1 if odd.
Now an array is happy if its sum is 0
We need to count how many subarrays with sum of 0 there is.
In order to do that we will store number of prefix sums,
an empty prefix has a sum of 0 so we store ct[0] = 1;
and later when we have prefix sum X we ask: how many prefixes had sum of X before that, and we add that number to the result
